CONTAINED WITHIN THE android-app FOLDER THERE IS A FILE CALLED app-debug.apk 
THIS FILE CAN BE DOWNLOADED ON AN ANDROID
WHEN CLICKED, THE ANDROID DEVICE WILL PROMPT THE USER TO ACCEPT THE INSTALLATION OF THE APK
GOOGLE WILL MOST LIKELY WARN YOU THE DEVELOPER OF THE APP (MYSELF (MASON)) IS NOT TRUSTED AND THE APP MAY CONTAIN VIRUSES
YOU WILL HAVE TO IGNORE THESE MESSAGES, AND SELECT A LITTLE DROP DOWN AND CLICK INSTALL ANYWAY
THE APP WILL THEN BE INSTALLED ON THE PHONE AND IS READY TO USE

THE ZIP FILE CALLED SelfDestructIM CONTAINS ALL THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE APP.
THE APP IS SHOWN AS Cipher ON THE PHONE BUT THE ORIGINAL NAME OF THE APP WAS CALLED SELFDESTRUCTIM.
I RECOMMEND OPENING THE SOURCE DIRECTORY IN ANDROID STUDIO TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE CODE
THERE ARE SEVERAL DEPENDANCIES AND CONFIGURATIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY ONLY SUPPORTED IN ANDROID STUDIO
